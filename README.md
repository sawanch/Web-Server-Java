## Project Description
The goal of this programming assignment is to build a functional web server. This assignment will teach you the basics of distributed programming, client/server structures, and issues in building high-performance servers. While the course lectures will focus on the concepts that enable network communication, it is also important to understand the structure of systems that make use of the global Internet.

## Instructions to Run the Program

1. Begin by using the Maven build tool to prepare the environment. Open the command-line interface and execute the command:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install

This step ensures that all project dependencies are in order, and it compiles the source code.

Once the Maven build process is complete, proceed to the next step. Navigate to the specific directory where the executable jar, named "WebServer.jar," is located. This jar file is found within the "target" directory of your project structure.

To run the jar, use the following command in the command line, specifying the document root and port:

java -jar WebServer.jar -document_root /path/to/document/root -port 8484

For example:

java -jar WebServer.jar -document_root /path/to/document-root -port 8484
